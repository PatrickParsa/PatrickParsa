✨ I'm a recent graduate in statistics and economics passionate about leveraging analytical tools to draw insights from data. In particular, I love soccer analytics and I am very excited to
get involved in its rapid growth by learning from community and adding my own contributions! 

Having just completed an Applied Data Science program, I am now looking for opportunities 
to gain valuable experience and continue my growth in the world of data.
